# hello-world

I am the Director of IT for a small financial firm.  Due to our size and lack of skilled IT personnel, I do alot of the heavy lifting (coding) myself.  I've stuck to the Microsoft stack (c#) most of my career, am currently learning MVC5, and try to stay up on new platforms and languages.
